Welcome to my submission for MK Challenge.

I finished the required tasks using MaterialUI, Node.JS, AWS, and an additional library called Formik. I emailed HR on Friday to ask about using this extra library but recieved no response. Though I could have completed this task with vanilla ReactJS, I ultimately decided against it. Building a form with basic ReactJS can be unnecessarily complicated, making it difficult for programmers and engineers to build a simple web form in ReactJS. Building a form is easy, it's something that can be done in PHP in a fraction of the time. Thus, I believe it makes sense to use something like Formik. Formik mainly deals with the most painful part of building a form in React, handling form submission. Formik simplifies the process significantly, allowing for clean, efficient, recyclable code. The company would be able to spend time wasted troubleshooting on this problem. Formik also understands that most people want flexibility when building their forms and so it is incredibly lightweight. It will not cause any sort of performance drop whatsoever. I believe it would be worth it here to try and reduce the amount of bugs and issues that we would have to deal with. 



# This project was built on top of Create React App
## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
